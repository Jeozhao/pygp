Welcome to PyGP
===============

This package provide Gaussian Process based regression. For
demonstrations we provide the two following classes:

    - :py:class:`demo_gpr` explains how to perform basic regression tasks.
    - :py:class:`demo_gpr_robust` shows how to apply EP for robust Gaussian process regression.


The different GP Regression classes provide following computations:

    - :py:class:`gpr` Basic gp regression package
    - :py:class:`gpr_ep` GP regression with EP likelihood models
