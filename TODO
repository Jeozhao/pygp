*TODOs

Cleanin up
1) Fix product CF
2) logging
3) update documentation to changes
*) differentiate between public and private functions and member varaibles.
*) import scipy as SP instead of from numpy import *
*) remove any playb depedendencies throughout
*) Private stuff _XXX, all at the end of classes

Functionality
*) Plotting functions (saussage plot) in a module plot.py
*) Implement shift operators as CF combinator (discuss)
1) support for mean functions? 
2) Implementation of diagional covariance matrices
3) Shift_X update (look at optimzed point)
4) Own Covariance class, which provides derivative w.r.t X
5) Let Iexp be given by CF


3) sq_dist using cython
4) Additional covariance functions
5) MCMC functionality
