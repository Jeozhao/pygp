*TODOs

Cleanin up
1) Fix product CF
*) logging
*) update documentation to changes
*) differentiate between public and private functions and member varaibles.
*) import scipy as SP instead of from numpy import *
*) remove any playb depedendencies throughout
*) Private stuff _XXX, all at the end of classes

Functionality
*) Plotting functions (saussage plot) in a module plot.py
*) Implement shift operators as CF combinator (discuss)
0) implement noise for each replicate
1) support for mean functions? 
2) Implementation of diagional covariance matrices
*) Shift_X update (look at optimzed point)
*) Own Covariance class, which provides derivative w.r.t X
*) Let Iexp be given by CF

3) sq_dist using cython
4) Additional covariance functions
5) MCMC functionality
